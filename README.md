# Lung Cancer Patterns Analysis (R)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project examining lung cancer patterns across age, gender, and smoking status using R. The goal is to clean the dataset, generate summary statistics, and produce clear visualizations that highlight how demographics and behavioral factors relate to lung cancer incidence.












#  Project Overview
Using a real lung cancer dataset, this project explores:

- Age distributions in lung cancer cases  
- Male vs. female differences  
- The strong relationship between smoking status and lung cancer  
- How risk factors may interact or differ across subgroups  

This analysis mirrors real-world public health workflows, in which demographic variables and behavioral exposures are examined to identify high-risk populations.













#  Methods & Tools

- R
- tidyverse (dplyr, tidyr)  
- ggplot2  
- Summary statistics, grouped counts, and frequency tables  
- Distribution plots and comparative visualizations  












#  Key Visualizations

The R script produces:

- Age distribution histogram  
- Boxplots comparing ages for smokers vs. non-smokers  
- Bar charts for gender frequency  
- Proportions of lung cancer cases across smoking groups  
- Combined demographic visual summaries  

These plots reflect the major findings described in the written report.












#  Skills Demonstrated

- Cleaning and structuring health data  
- R-based exploratory data analysis  
- ggplot2 visual storytelling  
- Identifying population-level trends  
- Translating analysis into written interpretation
